# UC-Irvine Institutional Analytics and Automation Dashboard Suite

This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive and dynamic analysis of UC-Irvine's faculty, expenditures, research funding, and degree completions from FY2012 to FY2023. By connecting the dashboards to a live SQL Server database and automating the data extraction from published datasets such as IPEDS, GSS, HERD, and SIS, I have created an end-to-end solution that updates in real-time with new records. This ensures that the dashboards always reflect the most current data, providing invaluable insights for decision-makers to optimize resource allocation, track trends, and improve strategic planning. The automation and integration demonstrate my expertise in SQL, Python scripting, data visualization, and database management, highlighting my ability to deliver scalable and impactful solutions that directly enhance business processes.




## Note

The Tableau dashboards created for this project are published and accessible online. You can interact with these dashboards to explore the data and see the results in real-time. The dashboards automatically reflect any updates to the underlying data, thanks to a live connection with the SQL Server database.
